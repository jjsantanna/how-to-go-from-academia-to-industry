# how-to-go-from-academia-to-industry

An student of mine asked me how to go from the academic skill to a job in the industry (cyber security). The following was my answer. I've decided to document the answer because more studens asked that.

Hi <DEAR-STUDENT-NAME>, it is really nice to hear your interest! <IT REALLY IS> 

After any academic course on cybersecurity, you already have some skills that you can say: "I know it!"

My advice is to discover which companies would be nice to work for/with. https://www.glassdoor.com/ is a Website with job offering. There you will know a bit more about companies in the sector you are searching for (I assume: cyber security) and also compare companies.

After that, you will be able to make a checklist of which skills they are searching for. Then, you should learn about those skills to the point to be able to talk about them. Finaly, you should contact the recruiter of the company. 

Please, prepare you Curriculum focussed on what the company is searching for (and you can offer). You should always say (in your CV) that "you are eager to learn and you are highly motivated to do it."

Let me know after your find a job OR after your "job interviews"
